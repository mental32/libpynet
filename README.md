<h1 align="center">pynet_framework</h1>
<p align="center">A complimentary framework to work with discord.py's (rewrite branch) commands extension.</p>

You can add the official bot [here](https://discordapp.com/oauth2/authorize?client_id=310153672472657922&scope=bot)

The pynet_framework is designed as a furter extension to the discord.py commands extension.<br>
It can be treated as both a bot instance and a python module since you may access `pynet.utils` without modifying any internal state. Although each instance of the module in a python process is indeed a seperate bot instance.
